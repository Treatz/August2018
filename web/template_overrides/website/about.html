<br><i>Mage: the Ascension Online is a virtual reality experience based on the role playing game by <a href="http://white-wolf.com/">White Wolf Publishing</a></i>
<div style="line-height: 1.5em;">
Magick is real, and Mages can shape reality through their application of belief, knowledge and will. With Magick the Awakened control great power, but one wrong move and that power can rip them, and the world to pieces. There was once a battle for reality between different Mages and their paradigms. Now the war is over. Most Mages have abandoned the "Real World," and are hiding deep in the spirit world in a place called the Horizon. 
<br><br>
The Ascension War ripped apart reality, and the Technocracy, a faction dedicated to controlling reality through technological means, has claimed the remaining pieces as their own. They rule a city known as the Telerium and control it with no checks or balances. The Technocracy fills the minds of humanity with scientific dogma and their version of truth. It is hard to take any action without the Technocracy knowing about it, and the forces of Paradox push back so hard Mages can end up dead before they can take out their wands. 
<br><br>
Until the rise of the Technocracy, Magick was a common occurrence, and in days past the horizon seemed just around the corner. Now it seems a lost, bitter fantasy. Still, there are Mages remaining in the Telerium, trying to escape. And Magick continues to survive in the secret corners of the city. 
<br><br>
The Horizon is a cross-roads for Mages, with portals leading in and out of myriad realms. It is said the Horizon is a place where mages can rework the tapestry of reality without fear of persecution. But the Horizon is in a state of perpetual decay. The energy source known as Quintessence was tied to the Earth. After the Earth shattered during the war, the flows of Quintessence waned. Both the Horizon and the Telerium are now in short supply. 
<br><br>
Based on the WoD (World of Darkness) game of the same name, you play a Mage trying to escape from the dark city they live in. The normal citizens in the city are unaware that Magick exists, and the Technocracy aims to keep it that way. The Technocracy wants to shield reality from entities entering the Telerium, but Spirits sometimes break through the barriers and cause chaos. You play a Mage trying to escape the city and find a haven from the Technocracy. 
<br><br>
When Mages use magic in public they draw the attention of the systems the Technocracy has in place. As a Mage, you can try to run or fight. But chances are that if you run, the Technocracy will hunt you and if you fight backup will arrive soon. Hidden places exist in the city where Magick is safe to use, places where sleepers don't go, and the Technocracy's hold is not absolute. Mages able to survive in these hidden corners advance in their study of the Spheres. 
<br><br>
Players of Mage: The Ascension Online will take the role of Awakened Mages of the Nine Mystic Traditions, or the Hollow Ones. Each member of these factions is trying to avoid capture by the Technocracy and find allies to aid in survival. The game progresses as players explore both the physical and nearby spirit realms. The Technocracy in this setting is monolithic, resourceful and brutally effective. They have become dehumanised overlords, akin to those of Threat Null. Perhaps Threat Null and the Technocracy are the same entity now. The details of what happened to our world after the Reckoning are unclear as there are few who witnessed it firsthand who can reveal the secrets of the past. Regardless of what came before, Telerium is the only home that most have known. The dark streets run in circles and there seems to be no escape from the city even though escaping from Telerium is the final goal. 
<br><br>
Almost everything you could want to do in the game is coded. While the online game uses the rules of the physical game as inspiration, there is no reason to roll dice, and storytellers can drop in at any time to help by controlling NPCs. Players can use emote commands as long as they aren't abused. 
<br><br>
If players interact with NPCs then the Storyteller will receive notice and can control the NPCs to role play with the players. This method is used to create running stories in the game and immerse players in a realistic, interactive and ambient environment. 
<br><br>
A lot of time has been spent on the combat system and ensuring it can be driven with the click of a mouse. Killing characters is allowed, but it can be easy to escape from a fight. In the event that you die, you will go into the spirit world. For those who can shape reality with their will, even death may not be the end.
<br><br>
Due to the setting of the game and the themes involved, players must choose a character from one group below. Players may not, at this stage, play members of the Technocracy, Nephandi, Marauder or Disparate factions.
<br><br>
Players can choose to create random characters at login, or through the character generator (Chargen). Everything in the game has an image attached to it, from people to places. Any colored underlined text can be clicked on with the mouse to see what objects look like, navigate exits, or take part in the menu driven combat. 
<br><br>
It is easy to create your own custom spells or Rotes with approval from Storytellers. This game is designed for World of Darkness role players and is directly inspired by the game Mage: The Ascension. The goal is to stay in character and explore Telerium with other Mage players. We suggest you find a safe place to set as your home where you can reconnect after you log off. 
<br><br>
The theme of the game is gothic punk. The city is dark and creepy and there doesn't seem to be any way out. Labyrinthine alleys twist and turn back on themselves. Crime is rampant, despite the overseeing eye of the Technocracy. The economy for practical purposes doesn't exist for Mages. They have to live without most of the luxuries of the city, often living in abandoned buildings or digging through dumpsters to find food. Survival in the bleak city of Telerium is a challenge. Only by working together will the desperate Mages have hope of escape. They must unify to adapt and survive in the shattered remnants of the Ascension War.
<br><br>
There are ten different Traditions of Mages who share Telerium and seek to escape to Horizon. The Traditions don't always get along, and most of time they're not even able to agree. Somehow this wildly divergent group must overcome their differences and find a way to rekindle Magick in this twilight world.
<br><br>
The ten traditions are:<br><br> 
Akashic Brotherhood - This tradition focuses on perfecting body and mind through the mystical martial art of Do
<br><br>
Celestial Chorus - Dedicated believers in a universal higher power, their power flows from their connection with the divine.
<br><br>
Cult of Ecstasy - The Cult of Ecstacy push the boundaries of reality by exploring taboos and perceptions through art, music and vice. 
<br><br>
Dreamspeakers - Spirit shamans drawn from myriad cultural backgrounds, unified by their deep respect and power in the spirit realms.
<br><br>
Euthanatos - Misunderstood servants of the wheel of life and death. They seek to understand luck, fate and mortality to guide the world to higher forms. 
<br><br>
The Order of Hermes - As the self-claimed founders of the Traditions the Order seeks to expand both its knowledge and power as practitioners of ritual High Magick.
<br><br>
Sons of Ether - Unorthodox innovators and explorers, the Etherites experiment and build upon scientific principles too strange or outmoded to be accepted by sleepers.
<br><br>
Verbena - Healers, naturalists, practitioners of primal and sometime visceral paths of Old Magick
<br><br>
Virtual Adepts - Reality hackers, tech adepts and spies
<br><br>
Hollow Ones - Dark dilettante will weavers who revel in the bleak days of the earth's demise.

Mage: The Ascension Online is a MUD that goes beyond being a MUD. MUDs have been around since the beginning of the internet, and have always just been interactive text.  The acronym MUD stands for Multi User Dimension. Today we have multiplayer RPGs with graphicts.  These graphical MUDs are known as  MMORPGs (Massively Multiplayer Online RPGs).   Mage: the Ascension Online is a graphical MUD on a budget. Not quite a commercial video game and not quite a text based MUD. Everything in Mage: the Ascension Online has an image attached to it, and movement around the MUD can be done with the click of a mouse. MUDs normally run on Telenet, but Mage the Ascension Online runs through a web client. You can still use an old telnet client and connect to telnet://mud.streetwitch.com:4000 where the game runs without the graphics.  You can also connect with your mobile devices using the graphical web app on this site.   Mage: the Ascension Online was built using the Python server Evennia, which is such a powerful back end for the game that it's possible to reprogram any aspect of it without shutting down the server.<br><br>
Following all the rules for the Mage the Ascension role playing game, we have taken the World Of Darkness combat system and programmed it to run as a part of the MUD. The combat system uses a turn based menu, which has clickable links. The links let you do things like attack, dodge, change weapons or anything else you might want to do. Many other online games require players and storytellers to role dice. In this game however there is no need for any storyteller to interfere in combat, or most of the time magick.  
<br><br>The Magick system is designed around the nine Spheres of the original game.  Magick can be used in three ways in the game.  The first is to do ritual magick, which involves having enough time and being in a safe location.  If your ritual is a success the Storyteller will bring the game alive to create anything your character imagines. The second way is to use one of the hard coded spells for each of the spheres (or combine them).  There are tons of spells for each of the spheres.  The third way is to design your own spell.  This combines the last two methods  to create a spell that you can use at a later time.
<br><br>
The nine spheres and the spells already coded for them are:
